Creates a drop-down menu in a bar across the bottom or top of the screen that makes it easy to jump to a page or post in the admin area for editing.

== Description ==

The WP Jump Menu plugin is a useful plugin that adds a drop-down "jump" menu to the bottom or top of the WordPress admin area filled with pages, posts, and custom post types.  When a page or post is selected, it jumps to edit that page.

Why is this needed?

By adding this ability, you can save loads of time when editing a bunch of posts or pages.  No more do you have to click on Pages, and then search for the right page in the list, and then click on the title or on edit.   Simply find the page or post in the drop-down (which is neatly organized and indented) and it will jump to edit that page or post.

Customizable

The plugin comes with an options page where you can edit the position (top or bottom) of the jump bar, the background color, font color, link color, border color and the icon and message that optionally get displayed on the left hand side.

Great for theme developers to help clients navigate in the admin area of WordPress.  We use this plugin on all of our projects and decided it was time to release it to the world!

Enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I edit the code? =

Of course! Go right ahead.

= How do I put my logo in? =

You need to upload your logo icon, through WordPress maybe, and get the full URL to the image.  This you will put into the Logo Icon field in the options.

You'll also need to specify the width of the icon, so that proper padding is given to the left of the message.
